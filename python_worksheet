question 11 :
answer) >> LIST: A List is similar to an array that consists of  group of elements or items. We can store different types of elements in a list. It is more versatile useful than an array. These are the most used datatypes in Python Programs

>> TUPLES: A Tuple is Pyhton Sequence which can store different elements and types of data like lists.  The difference between tuple and lists are that the lists are mutable and tuples are immutable. We cannot perform funtions like extend(), append(),insert(),pop() & clear() in tuples. Tuples should be used to store data which should not be modified and retrieve that data on demand.

>> SETS: A Set is an unordered collection of elements much like a set in mathematics. The order of elements is not maintained in the sets. It means the elements may not appear in the same order as they were entered. Also sets do not accept duplicate elements:
